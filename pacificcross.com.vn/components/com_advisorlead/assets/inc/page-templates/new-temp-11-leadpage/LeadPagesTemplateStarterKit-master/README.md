# Template Starter Kit

We thought creating a full-featured template would be a great way to document and share the various subtleties of a LeadPages template. As a bonus, we're making it available for all to use and learn from.

###To use this template (the easiest way):

1. clone or download this repository to your local desktop;
2. modify the contents of the "leadpages-template" directory;
3. archive the "leadpages-template" directory using the .zip file format;
4. upload the resulting archive to LeadPages.

###An awesomer way to get started: LeadPages™ Template Starter Kit Yeoman Generator:

If you are comfortable with command lines, [NPM](http://npmjs.org), check out our [LeadPages™ Template Starter Kit Yeoman Generator](https://github.com/LeadPages/LeadPagesYeoman). You can scaffold the template structure and start coding by just typing `yo lp-template`.
